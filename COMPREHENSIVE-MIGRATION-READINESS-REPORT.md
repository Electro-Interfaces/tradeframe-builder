Success will depend on careful extraction of business logic, comprehensive testing, and meticulous attention to financial data accuracy and security compliance.

**Key Success Factors:**
- Maintain data integrity throughout migration process
- Extract and validate all embedded business logic
- Implement robust rollback capabilities at each phase
- Ensure zero downtime for critical business operations
